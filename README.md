# nn-comparison

In this jupyter notebook we implement 4 networks

1. Deep network (at least 3 hidden layers)
2. Deep regularized network (with weight-decay enabled)
3. Deep regularized network (with weight-decay and dropout)
4. Deep regularized network (with weight-decay and early-stopping)

We compare their performance by visualizing their training and validation loss seperately

Finally we compare the 4 models on the basis of Accuracy metric and F-1 score.
